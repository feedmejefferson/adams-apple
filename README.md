# Adams Apple

This is just a quick and dirty throw away app intended to try out two (or three) main things:

1. Test out different UIs
2. See just how creepy google analytics can be
3. Try out Preact as a potential replacement for Angular

## CLI Commands
*   `npm install`: Installs dependencies

*   `npm run start`: Runs `serve` or `dev`, depending on `NODE_ENV` value. Defaults to `dev server`

*   `npm run dev`: Run a development, HMR server

*   `npm run serve`: Run a production-like server

*   `npm run build`: Production-ready build

*   `npm run lint`: Pass TypeScript files using TSLint

*   `npm run test`: Run Jest and [`preact-render-spy`](https://github.com/mzgoddard/preact-render-spy) for your tests


For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [CLI Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).
